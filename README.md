Sometimes you just want to transform the page's contents into a data URL - this userscript will do it.

Works for all HTML pages and *most* other data types:

   - SVGs refuse to work for some reason
   - Some images will not work if the HTTP headers are too restrictive.

# Usage
Click on Tampermonkey's icon and select "get data URL" when viewing the page/media you wish to URLise.

# Erm, Chrome dev tools?
Yes, Chrome's dev tools do allow you to get a data URL of an image, but they don't work for other media, e.g. sound;
plus, sometimes it's more convenient to use the monkey icon :smirk:
