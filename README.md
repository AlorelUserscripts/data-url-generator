Sometimes you just want to transform the page's contents into a data URL - this userscript will do it.

Works for all HTML pages and *most* other data types (SVGs will sometimes refuse to load)

# Usage
Click on Tampermonkey's icon and select "get data URL" when viewing the page/media you wish to URLise. Alternatively, click "Search for images" and get data URLs for every image on the page!
